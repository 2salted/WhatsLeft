# WhatsLeft
WhatsLeft is a messaging app similar to WhatsApp and Signal made to chat with your friends and family! It was made using React Native (Expo) and is tailored to IOS and Android only.

## How I built it
The development stack used to make this project was:

[React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) for the frontend
[Expo](https://expo.dev/) for building environment, bundling TS & routing
[Clerk](https://clerk.com/) for user authentication
[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) for database
[ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com/) for backend framework
